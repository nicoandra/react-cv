Leader of a team of 7 software developers owning 5 different projects. I'm in charge or coordinating tasks with the front-end team and product managers, understanding their needs and priorities.

Being a lead of 5 different projects I found myself de-duplicating code I've inherited; redesigning and developing new services.

After five successful years in the Tubes department, I requested to be transferred to Traffic Junky Platform Team, working on one of the most trafficked and profitable ad-networks in the adult industry.

As the new Tech Lead, with the help of my team and the support of our director, we managed to restructure the entire team to increase productivity by encouraging open communication, redesigned the internal workflow to better cover our needs, and had high influence and participation in the most complex and important projects such as database migration and scalability improvements.

I also actively participated in the talent acquisition process by driving interviews.
