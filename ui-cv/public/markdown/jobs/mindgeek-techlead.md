Leader of a back-end team of many software developers, managing 5 different projects. I'm in charge or coordinating tasks with front-end team and with product managers, understanding their needs and priorities, and bringing them to the development team in a technical language.

Being a lead of 5 different projects I found myself de-duplicating code I've inherited; redesigning and developing new services as wells as alternative implementations, helping other leads and bringing my best in all social, interpersonal and technical aspects.


After five successful years in the Tubes department, I asked to be transferred to Traffic Junky Platform Team, working on one of the most trafficked and profitable ad-networks in the adult industry.

As a new lead, with the help of my team and the support of our director, we managed to restructure the entire team to increase productivity by encouraging open communication, redesigned the internal workflow to better cover our needs, and had high influence and participation in the most advanced and important projects.

I also participated in the talent acquisition process, in the design and development of the new framework, among other projects.
