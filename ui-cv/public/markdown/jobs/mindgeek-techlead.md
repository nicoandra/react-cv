Leader of a team of 7 software developers owning 5 different projects, being the interface between the Front-End, Back-End and Product Owners.

After five years in the Tubes department, I moved to the Traffic Junky Platform Team, working on one of the most trafficked and profitable ad-networks in the adult industry; improving the CMS system and implementing data analytics.
