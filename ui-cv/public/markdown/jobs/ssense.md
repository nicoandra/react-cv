Joined as Senior Software Developer and shortly after got promoted to Tech Lead. My main responsabilities are to design, document, develop, test and deploy the cloud-based services needed to perform operations in the Pricing domain; aiming for availability, scalability, simplicity, predictability and performance.

### Main Responsibilities:

* Identify and eliminate bottlenecks, find opportunities for performance improvement and cost reduction across the applications in the domain.

* Ensure good monitoring of applications, aiming to respect all service-level objectives and emitting alerts upon any incident or significant service disruption.
